## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (8.0+ local or Atlas)
- Python (3.11 or 3.12 recommended for ML services)
- Git
- npm

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Update .env values, then run:
npm run dev
# Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

Windows alternative:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

**Backend `.env` example:**

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/healance_ai
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_this
JWT_EXPIRE=15m
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Optional
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key           # free tier from console.groq.com/keys — powers report analysis
GEMINI_API_KEY=                      # optional fallback LLM (aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-whatsapp-access-token
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your-whatsapp-phone-number-id
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+12345678900
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
# Create .env file manually (Frontend/.env.example is not present)
# Set API URL:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
npm run dev
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend `.env` example:**

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Note: frontend code fallback points to `http://localhost:5001/api` if `VITE_API_URL` is not set, so keep `Frontend/.env` explicit to avoid port mismatch.

### ML Services Setup (Python)

```bash
# Heart & Diabetes ML service
cd "ML Services/Heart&diabeties"
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Symptom-to-Disease ML service
cd "../Symtums_diseas"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train models only when you need to regenerate artifacts:

```bash
cd "ML Services/Heart&diabeties"
python train_models.py

cd "../Symtums_diseas"
python train_symptom_model.py
```

Optional backend runtime override:

```env
PYTHON_BIN=python
```

### Optional Seed Data

```bash
cd Backend
npm run seed
```

Creates demo users, blog posts, rewards, and sample health goals.

## UI & Design

- Clean and modern Tailwind CSS based interface
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile (tested down to 375 px)
- Smooth animation with Framer Motion + GSAP
- Reusable component-driven frontend architecture
- Focused, health-centric UX across modules

### Design system extensions

The `.dash-*` utility family in `Frontend/src/index.css` was extended with:

- `.dash-card-hero` - 20 px radius card with indigo -> white -> rose gradient background and glow blobs, used for Health Score hero
- `.dash-card-accent` - per-section 3 px colored left stripe (`--accent-stripe`) so each card reads as a distinct zone
- `.dash-card-glow` - re-enabled hover lift (`translateY(-3px)` + accent-ring shadow) for interactive cards
- `.dash-gradient-text` - indigo -> cyan background-clip text used for hero score and section titles
- `.dash-icon-badge--gradient-{indigo|rose|emerald|amber|cyan|violet}` - 6 gradient icon-badge variants with color-matched lifted shadow
- `.dash-chip`, `.dash-chip--ai` - pill badges used by Smart Insights header

### Shared UI primitives

- `CircularGauge` (SVG ring with animated gradient stroke + count-up) - used by Health Score hero and Risk Prediction confidence display
- `Sparkline` (7-point inline SVG with gradient fill) - used by the Daily Steps stat card
- `useCountUp` hook - tweens numbers from previous value over 800 ms on any change (Hero score, streak, goal %)
- `SkeletonHero` / `SkeletonQuickActions` added to `Skeleton.jsx`

### Page-by-page polish (every dashboard page)

Every dashboard route now uses the extended design system consistently:

- `Dashboard.jsx` - Hero -> Quick Actions -> enhanced stat row -> Weekly Trends + Today's Focus -> Latest Symptoms + Smart Insights -> Recent Activity
- `RiskPrediction.jsx` - gradient-text title, `CircularGauge` on result hero, gradient icon badges on all 6 detail cards
- `HeartDiabetesPrediction.jsx` - gradient-tinted risk result cards (rose for elevated, emerald for safe), gradient BMI panel, accent-stripe suggestions card
- `AIChatbots.jsx` - gradient tab indicators (indigo for health, rose for medicine), gradient typing avatar
- `ReversePlanner.jsx` - 6-color gradient progress bars per goal type, gradient bar chart, priority-tinted AI suggestions
- `Forecast.jsx` - gradient pill for active city, gradient "today" day cell, gradient icon badges on all section headers, gradient numbered health tips
- `DashboardBlogs.jsx` - `.dash-card-glow` blog cards, gradient category badges, amber "Trending" ribbon, brand-gradient Saved Articles CTA
- `DashboardContact.jsx` - color-coded gradient icon badges (indigo email / emerald phone / amber hours), gradient hover on upload dropzone
- `Profile.jsx` - avatar wrapped in gradient ring frame, glass gradient background on profile-photo panel
- `PredictionHistory.jsx` - gradient tone badges, icon-prefixed history list rows, pill-toggle tabs with gradient icons

## Dashboard Experience

The main dashboard at `/dashboard` was rebuilt top-to-bottom to show only real data. The composition is:

1. **Health Score Hero** - animated circular gauge driven by a composite formula (30% steps %, 25% water %, 25% active-goal completion avg, 20% prediction recency), streak counter that walks back day-by-day counting days with `stepsPct >= 50 || waterPct >= 50`, and a rule-based **Next Action** CTA (`steps < 50%` -> "Take a walk", `water < 75%` -> "Drink water", no prediction in 7 d -> "Check symptoms", else "You're on track").
2. **Quick Actions bar** - three gradient pill buttons: Run Symptoms Check, Start Walking, Add a Goal. Full 3-col grid on mobile with icon-over-label layout; row layout on desktop.
3. **Enhanced stat row** - Daily Steps with 7-point sparkline + trend chip, Water Intake glass grid with gradient fills and radial goal indicator, Active Goals showing top-2 mini progress bars, Weather tied to `forecast.activities[0]` for a health-aware "Great for a walk" chip.
4. **Weekly Health Trends** (real data) - multi-series area chart: healthScore (indigo -> cyan gradient fill), stepsPct (orange line), waterPct (cyan dashed line). Pill-toggle for 7 d / 30 d range, legend strip with current values, tooltip showing all three metrics per day.
5. **Today's Focus** - pulled from the user's real goals, one row per goal with gradient progress bar matching the goal type (water=cyan, steps=amber, sleep=indigo, etc.), one-tap `+` button that calls `POST /goals/:id/progress`.
6. **Latest Symptoms Prediction** - violet accent card with direct "View full details" link to the symptoms page.
7. **Smart Insights** - calls `GET /api/dashboard/insights` which sends today's context (steps, water, goals, latest predictions) to OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` (JSON response, max 400 tokens, 15-min in-memory cache per user). Each insight has a severity-tinted icon (info=blue, warn=amber, critical=rose). Automatic fallback to a rule-based generator if the LLM is unavailable.
8. **Recent Activity** - single card that unifies symptoms + heart/diabetes history, tabbed with All / Symptoms / Heart & Diabetes, dedupes consecutive identical symptom rows with a `x2` chip, each row icon-differentiated and clickable through to its detail page.

### Required environment for the dashboard

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - powers Smart Insights LLM; if missing the card automatically shows rule-based tips instead (no broken state).
- No other config needed - all data flows from existing `WalkEarn`, `HealthData`, `Goal`, `SymptomPrediction`, and `RiskPrediction` models.

---

## AI Personal Health Assistant

The dashboard AI Chatbot page is a full personal health assistant. All new integrations are free and key-light — only `GROQ_API_KEY` is required.

### Capabilities

- **Report Analysis:** Upload a medical report (PDF/DOCX) through the chat paperclip. The backend extracts text (`pdf-parse` / `mammoth`), sends it to Groq Llama 3.3 70B with a strict JSON schema, and returns a structured payload: `reportType`, `summary`, `keyFindings[]`, `flags[]`, `recommendedActions[]`, `suggestedMedications[]`, `suggestedSpecialists[]`. The frontend renders a `ReportSummaryCard` with action buttons (Explain medications / Find nearby specialist).
- **Medicine Explanation:** Any drug name is enriched with openFDA label fields (uses, dosage, side effects, warnings, interactions, contraindications) + RxNav drug class. `fdaTextCleaner.js` strips FDA cross-references like `[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]`, section prefixes, and duplicate sentences. Interactions are keyword-matched against the logged-in user's `profile.medications` and a red banner is shown for any hit.
- **Nearby Specialists:** A seeded `Doctor` MongoDB collection (2dsphere index) is queried by `$geoNear`. If fewer than 4 seeded doctors match in the radius, OpenStreetMap Overpass is queried for `amenity=hospital|clinic|doctors`. Results are merged and rendered in a `DoctorGrid` with Call / Map / Book action buttons. Location comes from browser geolocation or a manual city input (geocoded via Open-Meteo).

### Free data sources (no API key required)

- **openFDA** — drug label data
- **NIH RxNav** — drug normalization + ATC drug class
- **OpenStreetMap Overpass** — nearby healthcare places
- **Open-Meteo Geocoding** — city -> coordinates

### Required key

- `GROQ_API_KEY` from [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) — free tier powers report analysis.

### Seed the doctor directory

```bash
cd Backend
node seeds/seedDoctors.js
```

Seeds ~25 curated specialists across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Troubleshooting

**MongoDB Connection Error**

- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
- Check `MONGO_URI` in `Backend/.env`

**CORS or API URL Errors**

- Verify `CLIENT_URL` in backend `.env`
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in `Frontend/.env`
- Ensure backend and frontend ports match configured URLs (`5000` recommended)

**Python / ML Errors**

- Install Python dependencies in both ML folders under `ML Services`
- If backend cannot find Python, set `PYTHON_BIN` in `Backend/.env`
- If model files are missing, run `train_models.py` and `train_symptom_model.py`

**Token/Auth Issues**

- Clear cookies/local storage and login again
- Check JWT secret consistency across environment
